# üôã Sentences

## 1. Numbers and Letters
### Integer
```ruby
integer = 1
```
The variable `integer` is initialized to reference an Integer object with value `1`.
### Float
```ruby
float = 1.0
```
The variable `float` is initialized to reference a Float object with value `1.0`.
### String
```ruby
a = "string"
```
The variable `a` is initialized and to reference a String object with value `"string"`.

## 2. String Manipulation
### Interpolation
```ruby
b = "#{a}!"
```
The variable `b` is initialized. The value of `a` (which is `"string"`) is interpolated into the string `"#{a}!"`, resulting in the string `"string!"` being assigned to the variable `b`.
### Non-mutating Concatenation
```ruby
b += "!"
```
The string `"!"` is concatenated to the string held by `b`. The `+=` operator creates a new string with the concatenated value, reassigning `b` to point to a new string object with value `"string!!"`.
### Mutating Concatenation
```ruby
b << "!"
```
The string `"!"` is concatenated to the string held by `b`. The shovel operator `<<` mutates the original string object that `b` references, modifying its value to `"string!!!"`.
## 3. Boolean Logic and Values
### Boolean value
```ruby
boolean = true
```
The local variable `boolean` is initialized and assigned the boolean `true`.
### Truthiness
```ruby
if integer
	puts "string"
end
```
The conditional statement `if` evaluates if `a` is truthy. As everything in Ruby is truthy except `false` and `nil`, the `if` branch is executed.
### nil
```ruby
nil == false
```
`nil == false` comparison expression evaluates whether the value of `nil` is equal to the value of boolean `false`. It returns `false`, indicating that `false` and `nil` are not equal.

counter = 0

while counter < 5 do
	counter += 1
end 
```
On line 1, the local variable `counter` is initialized to reference the Integer object with value `0`.
On line 3, the `while` keyword initiates a loop. The loop continues executing while the condition `counter < 5` evaluates as true.
Inside the loop, on line 4, `counter` is incremented by `1`. According to the condition, the loop executes 5 times. 
After loop complete execution, `counter` now holds the value `5`.

After loop complete execution, `counter` now holds the value `5`.

### `for` Loop
```ruby
for num in 1..3 do
	puts num
end
```
On line 1, the `for` keyword initiates an iteration through the range `1..3`, assigning each value of `1..3` to the variable `num`.
Inside the loop, on line 2, the `puts` method is called with the current value of `num` passed to it as an argument. It outputs
```
1
2
3
```
### `times` method

```ruby
3.times do |index|
	puts "Hello!"	
end
```
On line 1, the `times` method is called on the Integer `3`. A block delimited by `do..end` is passed to it as an argument. `times` loops `3` times, assigning the current zero-indexed iteration number to block variable `index`.
Inside the block, on line 2, the `puts` method is called with string `"Hello!"` passed to it as an argument.
It will output `"Hello!"` 3 times. 
`times` returns the number of iterations completed.s

### `each` Iterator
```ruby
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

fruits.each do |fruit|
	puts fruit
end
```
On line 3, the `each` method is called on the `fruits` array. 
A block delimited by `do..end` is passed to it as an argument. 
`each` iterates through each element of `fruits`, assigning the current element to the block variable `fruit`. 
Inside the block, on line 4, the `puts` method is called with the value of `fruit` passed to it as an argument. 
It will output the value of `fruit` for each element in `fruits`.
`each` returns the original array it has been called on, which is `["apple", "banana", "orange"]`



### `map` Iterator
```ruby
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

fruits.map do |fruit|
	fruit + " is good"
end
```
On line 3, the `map` method is called on the `fruits` array. 
A block delimited by `do..end` is passed to it as an argument. 
`map` iterates through each element of `fruits`, assigning the current element to the block variable `fruit`. 
Inside the block, on line 4, the `+` operator is used to concatenate the string `" is good"` to the string referenced by `fruit`. 
The result of this expression is then returned by the block to the `map` method. 
`map` returns an array with each returned value from the block, which is `["apple is good", "banana is good", "orange is good"]`.

### `break` Statement
```ruby
loop do
	break
end
```
The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely.

### `next` Statement
```ruby
var = 0

loop do
	var += 1
	next if var == 1
	break if var == 2
end
```
On line 5, the `next` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and execute the next one if `var` equals `1`.

### `if` Statement
```ruby
age = 18

if age >= 18
	puts "You are an adult."
else
	puts "You are a minor."
end
```
On line 3, the `if` statement checks if `age` is greater than or equal to `18`.
The condition evaluates as true, so the body of `if` is executed.
On line 4, the `puts` method is called and the string `"You are an adult"` is passed to it as an argument.
### `case` Statement
```ruby
day = "Wednesday"

case day
when "Monday"
	puts "Start of the workweek."
when "Wednesday"
	puts "Midweek!"
else
	puts "Another day."
end
```
The `case` statement compares the value of `day` against multiple `when` conditions.
As `day` value is `"Wednesday"`, the body corresponding to the `"Wednesday"` `when` condition is executed.

### `unless` Statement
```ruby
rainy_day = true

unless rainy_day
	puts "It's a sunny day!"
else
	puts "Don't forget your umbrella."
end
```
The `unless` statement checks if `rainy_day` is falsy.
If the condition evaluates as false, the body of `unless` is executed; otherwise, the code in the `else` body is executed.

### Ternary Operator
```ruby
x = 5
x > 3 ? "x is greater than 3" : "x is not greater than 3"
```
The ternary operator is used to evaluate the condition `x > 3`.
If the condition evaluates as true, it returns `"x is greater than 3"`; otherwise, it returns `"x is not greater than 3"`.


## 10. Output, Return & Expressions
### Output
```ruby
puts "hello"
```
The string `"hello"` is passed as an argument to the `puts` method call. It will output `"hello"` and return `nil`.

	return bar
end
```
On line 2, the value of the `bar` variable is explicitly returned with the use of the `return` keyword.

## 12. Concepts

- Errors being raised
- Code is expected to perform in a certain way VS actually performed

### Local Variable Scope
#### Blocks
This code demonstrates the concept of Local Variable Scope within blocks. When a block is defined, the local variables from the outer scope are accessible within the block. However, variables initialized within the block are confined to that block's scope and cannot be accessed outside of it.
#### Methods
This code demonstrates the concept of Local Variable Scope within methods. When a method is defined, the local variables from the outer scope are not accessible within the method. Additionnally, variables initialized within the method are confined to that method's scope and cannot be accessed outside of it. However, we can pass the value of a variable as an argument to a method, thus binding it to a method's parameter. It makes an outer scope variable now accessible inside the method.
#### Both
This code demonstrates the concept of Local Variable Scope. When a method is defined, the local variables from the outer scope are not accessible within the method. Additionnally, variables initialized within the method are confined to that method's scope and cannot be accessed outside of it. However, we can pass the value of a variable as an argument to a method, thus binding it to a method's parameter. It makes an outer scope variable now accessible inside the method. Furthermore, in a block, things are a bit different. We can access outer scope variables, but any variable initialized inside the block can't be accessed outside of it.
### Variable Shadowing
This code demonstrates the concept of Variable Shadowing. It happens when a variable declared within a block scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. The inner variable then shadows the outer variable. Meaning, the outer variable is inaccessible within the block. 
### Variables as Pointers
This code demonstrates the concept of Variables as Pointers. In Ruby, variables don't directly hold values. They act as pointers (or references to memory locations) where values are stored. When variables are assigned, they point to these memory locations. If another variable is assigned the same value, both variables point to the same memory location, effectively sharing the same value.
### Object Mutability
This code demonstrates the concept of Object Mutability. It refers to whether an object's internal state can be changed after it's created. Mutable objects can have their state modified, while immutable objects cannot. Strings, arrays and hashes in Ruby are mutable, meaning their content can be changed without creating a new object. Float, integers, ranges, symbols, booleans and nil, on the other hand, are immutable, so any operation that appears to modify them actually creates a new object.
### Pass by Reference/Pass by Value
This code demonstrates the concept of Pass by Reference/Pass by Value. In Ruby, variables act as pointers, so when they are passed to methods they are actually passing a reference to the object. Changes to those objects with the use of mutating methods within the method will affect their original value. However, Ruby also uses a strategy called 'pass-by-value'. If a new object is assigned within the method, it won't change the original object. This latter strategy is always used for immutable objects (integers, floats, ranges, symbols, booleans, nil).
### Truthiness
This code demonstrates the concept of Truthiness. In Ruby, all values evaluate as true in a boolean context except for `false` and `nil`. Because of this, we can use any type of value in a condition such as the one found in an `if` statement. For example, in Ruby, if we write `if 0` or `if []` the condition evaluates as `true`.

### Output vs Return Values
This code demonstrates the concept of Output vs Return Values. Output is what your program writes to the terminal using methods like `puts` or `print`. Return value, on the other hand, is the value that a method leaves behind, which can then be used in another context. In Ruby, if no return value is explicitly indicated with the `return` keyword, the method will automatically return the result of the last line of code executed within it.
### Side Effects
This code demonstrates the concept of Side Effects. In Ruby, a function has a side effect if it changes the state of something outside its own scope. This could be modifying an external variable, writing to the console, or changing the content of a file.
### Implicit/Explicit Return Value
This code demonstrates the concept of Implicit/Explicit Return Value. In Ruby, a method will automatically return the value of the last line of code executed. This is called an implicit return. If you want to return an earlier value, or make it more clear what a method's return is, you can use the `return` keyword followed by the value you want to return. This is called an explicit return.
### Operator Precedence
This code demonstrates the concept of Operator Precedence. In Ruby, different operators have different precedence. This means that in expressions where multiple operators are present, certain operations will be performed before others. From highest precedence to lowest: Parentheses, Exponentiation, Unary minus and plus, Multiplication Division and Modulus, Addition and Substraction, Comparison operators, Logical AND, Logical OR, Ternary operator and finally Assignement operators.
### Collection Methods
This code demonstrates the concept of Collection Methods. Collections, such as arrays or hashes, have methods (functions pre-built into Ruby) that can operate on them to manipulate data. 
### Call Stack
This code demonstrates the concept of a Call Stack. As a Ruby program runs, it keeps track of what functions are being called in a structure known as a call stack. Each time a method is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack which contains the function's local variables. When the function exits, its frame is popped from the stack.
